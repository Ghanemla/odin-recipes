    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A very simple and easy marinade that makes your shrimp so yummy you don't even need cocktail sauce! Don't let the cayenne pepper scare you, you don't even taste it.</p> 
      My 2 and 4 year-olds love it and eat more shrimp than their parents! It is also a big hit with company, and easy to prepare. <p>
      I make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good for outside grilling.</p> 
      Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread. You will not be disappointed!!!

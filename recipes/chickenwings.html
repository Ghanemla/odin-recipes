      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h4>These boneless wings are a great way to have chicken. 
      I had these at a pub and fell in love with the taste.
      <p>
      They're a nice change from your regular chicken wings. 
      Serve with blue cheese dressing for dipping.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>oil fro deep frying</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>&#189; teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>&#189; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>&#189; tesspoon paprika powder</li>
      <li>&#188; teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li> 1 cup milk</li>
      <li>3 skinless boneless chicken breasts cut into &#189; inch strips</li>
      <li>&#188; cup hot pepper sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Combine flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl. 
        Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Dip each piece of chicken in egg mixture, then roll in flour mixture. 
        Repeat so that each piece of chicken is double-coated. 
        Refrigerate breaded chicken for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Fry chicken in hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Combine hot sauce and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat sauce in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. 
        Pour sauce over fried chicken; mix to coat.
